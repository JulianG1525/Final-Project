                    Les Paul History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By the early 1950s, as Fender's solid-body guitars gained popularity,
                    Gibson recognized the need to compete. They partnered with Les Paul, who was already a famous
                    musician and innovator, to develop a solid-body electric guitar.The first Gibson Les Paul model was
                    introduced in 1952, featuring a carved maple top, mahogany body,
                    and P-90 pickups. This design provided a warm tone and sustain that appealed to jazz and blues
                    musicians.

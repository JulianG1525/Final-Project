                    Stratocaster History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Fender Stratocaster was designed by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares between 1952 and 1954.
                    It was intended as a more advanced model compared to the earlier Telecaster, featuring a double-cutaway body shape that was revolutionary at the time.
                    The Stratocaster's design included contoured edges for comfort, a three-pickup configuration, and a vibrato arm that allowed for pitch modulation, which set it apart from other guitars of the era.

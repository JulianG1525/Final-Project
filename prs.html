                    PRS History
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Paul Reed Smith founded PRS Guitars in 1985 with the goal of combining the precision and playability
                    of modern instruments with the soul and character of vintage classics. Working originally out of a
                    small workshop in Maryland, Smith hand-built guitars for well-known musicians to prove his designs
                    and craftsmanship. His early models introduced signature features like bird inlays, carved figured
                    maple tops, and a uniquely shaped body that blended elegance with comfort. From the beginning, PRS
                    set out to create instruments that were both visually stunning and sonically versatile.

                <h3>
                    Its Impact
                </h3>
                <p>
                    PRS quickly made an impact on the guitar world by bridging the gap between Fender’s clarity and
                    Gibson’s warmth, offering players a new level of tonal flexibility. Their guitars became known for
                    exceptional build quality, consistent performance, and modern reliability, attracting artists from
                    multiple genres. Musicians like Carlos Santana helped bring PRS into the spotlight by showcasing its
                    expressive tone on major stages. As a result, PRS reshaped expectations for what a high-end electric
                    guitar could deliver in terms of craftsmanship and sound.
